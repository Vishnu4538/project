Here’s a clear comparison between git cherry-pick and git merge, Vishnu — both are used to bring changes from one branch to another, but they work very differently:

🆚 Cherry-pick vs Merge
| Feature | git cherry-pick | git merge | 
| 🔍 What it does | Applies specific commit(s) to current branch | Combines entire branch history into current branch | 
| 📜 History impact | Creates new commit(s) with different hashes | Preserves original commit history with a merge commit | 
| 🎯 Use case | Apply a single fix or feature from another branch | Integrate all changes from a feature or dev branch | 
| 🔄 Commit relation | Cherry-picked commits are unrelated to original | Merged commits retain parent-child relationship | 
| ⚠️ Conflict handling | Conflicts handled per commit | Conflicts handled once during merge | 
| 🧹 Clean history | Can keep history clean if used sparingly | Can clutter history with merge commits if frequent | 
| 🔄 Reusability | Good for backporting or hotfixes | Best for full feature integration | 



🧪 Example
🔸 Cherry-pick
git switch main
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d


➡️ Applies commit a1b2c3d from another branch to main.
🔸 Merge
git switch main
git merge feature-branch


➡️ Brings all commits from feature-branch into main.

🧠 When to Use
- ✅ Use cherry-pick when:
- You want just one commit (e.g., a bug fix or small feature)
- You’re backporting changes to an older branch
- You want to avoid merging unrelated history
- ✅ Use merge when:
- You’re ready to integrate a full feature branch
- You want to preserve commit history
- You’re working in a collaborative workflow
