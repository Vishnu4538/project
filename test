ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips- Use a visual tool like VS Code or GitKraken to resolve conflicts more easily.
- Avoid using git add . unless you're sure all files are ready to be staged.
- If you want to favor one side during merge:



 Common VCS Workflows
A. Centralized Workflow (CVCS)
Check out files from the central server.

Edit & commit changes back to the server.

Resolve conflicts if multiple people edit the same file.

B. Feature Branch Workflow (DVCS - Git)
Clone the repository (git clone).

Create a branch for a new feature (git checkout -b feature-x).

Commit changes locally.

Push to remote & create a Pull Request (PR) for review.

Merge into main after approval.
