5. Common VCS Workflows
A. Centralized Workflow (CVCS)
Check out files from the central server.

Edit & commit changes back to the server.

Resolve conflicts if multiple people edit the same file.

B. Feature Branch Workflow (DVCS - Git)
Clone the repository (git clone).

Create a branch for a new feature (git checkout -b feature-x).

Commit changes locally.

Push to remote & create a Pull Request (PR) for review.

Merge into main after approval.

C. Git Flow (Structured Branching)
Uses long-lived branches:

main (production)

develop (staging)

feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*

6. Importance in DevOps & CI/CD
Continuous Integration (CI) relies on VCS to trigger automated builds.

Code Reviews (via PR/Merge Requests) improve quality.

Deployment Pipelines use versioned releases (git tag).

7. Best Practices
✔ Commit Often – Small, logical changes with clear messages.
✔ Use Branches – Avoid working directly on main.
✔ Pull Before Push – Prevent merge conflicts.
✔ Leverage .gitignore – Exclude temp files (logs, binaries).

Conclusion
Version control is essential for:

Individual developers (backup & history).

Teams (collaboration & conflict resolution).

Enterprises (audit trails & compliance).

Git (DVCS) is the industry standard, but SVN/Perforce (CVCS) still has niche uses.
